The universe is amazing. It’s awe inspiring. It’s every synonym combined and more. In every nook and cranny, in every hill and valley, from every star to swirling galaxy, the universe is full of puzzles and mysteries, beauty and intricacies. It’s a place of wonder, where everything is “to be discovered,” and there is so much to adore.
  
The way I see it, computer science is a tool. More and more, we rely on computers to see what we cannot, to recognize patterns in the chaos, to run simulations for our experiments. This is the reason for my interest in machine learning and data analysis.
  
As for software engineering, my interest is twofold, as a means to an end and as an intriguing approach to problem solving. I am excited to learn more about software development and implementation, and I am thrilled by the promise of structure and efficiency. Some of my other goals are to become more mindful of my professional persona, and, perhaps most importantly, to increase my proficiency in a group setting.
